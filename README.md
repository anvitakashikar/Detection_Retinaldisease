# Detection of Retinal Disease
Welcome to Retinal Disease Detection Project!

This project is done using Google Colab. All the machine learning projects are created using python. In this project, the Supervised Learning Algorithms are used. The Supervised Learning Algorithm involves training a model on a labled dataset, where input dataset is paired with correct output. It is further classified into Regression and Classification. In this project, classification algorithms like CNN and RNN algorithms are used. In this project, mainly the unstructured data type like images, is used. But, structured data types like tables is also used to sort the data, arrange and classify the data.

CNN (Convolution Neutral Networks) is a class of deep neural network used to process and analyze the visual data like images and videos. The architecture of this algorithm is based in the visual cortex of the human brain. CNN mainly focuses on the convolutional layer, where a set of filters is applied to the input to produce the features of the image. These filters capture the features like texture, edges, shapes, etc.

RNN (Reccurent Neural Networks) are designed for handling sequential data, where the order of the data points is crucial. Unlike traditional neural networks, RNNs have loops that allow information to persist across time steps, making them ideal for tasks involving time series, language modeling, and speech recognition. Each neuron in an RNN maintains a hidden state that gets updated at each time step based on the current input and the previous hidden state. This architecture enables RNNs to maintain context and memory of previous inputs, which is essential for understanding sequences.

KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)KNN is advantageous due to its simplicity and effectiveness for small to medium-sized datasets, and it requires no explicit training phase is an algorithm used for classification and regression of tasks. It classifies data point based on proximity to other data points. The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, non-parametric, and instance-based learning method used primarily for classification and regression tasks. 

A Keras Model was imported using Tensorflow. Keras is a high-level neural network API written in Python, designed to be user-friendly, modular, and extensible, making it accessible to both beginners and experts in the field. It provides a simple interface for defining complex neural network architectures, allowing users to build models using layers, compile them with optimizers and loss functions, and fit them to data using a few lines of code. It provides the necessary infrastructure and computational power to execute the operations defined by Keras models, including efficient tensor operations, automatic differentiation, and GPU/TPU acceleration
While Tensorflow is an open-source machine learning and deep learning framework and provides the tools and flexibility needed to succeed.
They work together to simplify the process building, training and deployment of machine learning algorithms. By using Keras with TensorFlow as the backend, users benefit from TensorFlow's robust performance and scalability while enjoying the simplicity and flexibility of Keras for model design and experimentation.
