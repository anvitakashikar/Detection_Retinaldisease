# Detection of Retinal Disease
Welcome to Retinal Disease Detection Project!

This project is done using Google Colab. All the machine learning projects are created using python. In this project, CNN and RNN algorithms are used.  

CNN that is Convolution Neutral Networks is a class of deep neural network used to analyze the visual data. Through this algorithm, I could analyze the data set that was in the image form.

KNN that is K-Nearest Neighbors, is an algorithm used for classification and regression of tasks. It classifies data point based on proximity to other data points.

A Keras Model was imported using Tensorflow. A Keras Model is an open-source deep learning library written in Python. It is designed to simplify the creation and training of neural networks, providing a high-level interface. 
While Tensorflow is an open-source machine learning and deep learning framework.
